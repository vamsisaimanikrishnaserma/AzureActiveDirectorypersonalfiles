Other Important Questions:
--------------------------

1.Insprint in Agile:
--------------------
-->To develop and automate user stories in the same sprint, is called in-sprint automation.
-->If there are 4 User stories in a sprint which could be automated then, We will write a skeleton scripts for the User stories 
   which we are going to automate it in this sprint. 
-->In a 2 weeks sprint, for 6 days developer will Develop the application and on 7th day the build is delivered to Automation team.
   After that we will execute the scripts.


2.Outsprint or n-1 Sprint:
---------------------------
-->To automate user stories for the previous sprint, is called out-sprint automation.
-->Say there were 4 User stories from previous Sprint (Sprint1) which could be automated. 
-->I will automate it in Sprint 2, which is called as n-1 or outsprint automation.
-->In my previous Sprint i.e Sprint 1, I will be working on the framework setup.


3.Velocity:
-----------
-->Total Number of user story points consider in a particular sprint (We can say 40 Points)


4.Capacity:
-----------
-->Total no of working days*Total no of resouces*Total number of working hours(PD) = Capacity
	Capacity= 10*7*8


5.Risk Based Testing:
---------------------
-->Identifying the functionalities which seems to cause failures to the application and then testing those functionalities.


6.Bug Leakage:
---------------
-->Bug which is missed by the testing team while testing and if it is found by the end user or customer in Live Environment.


7.Bug Release:
--------------
-->Releasing the application to the Live Environment with the known bugs then we call it as Bug Release. 


8.Defect Age:
-------------
-->It is the time interval between date of defect detection and date of defect closure.
-->Defect Age = Date of defect closure – Date of defect detection
-->For Examaple, A defect was fonded and reported on 17 May 2020 and it was fixed on 22 May 2020. So the defect age is 5 days.


9.HotFix:
---------
-->A bug which needs to handle as more than high priority bug and needs to be fix it immediately.


10.RTM:
-------
-->Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) is used to trace the requirements are done by the testing side by matching 
   the requirement with test cases.


11.Test Suite:
--------------
-->Test Suite is a collection of test cases.


12.Test Strategy:
-----------------
-->It is a high-level document which captures the approach on how we go about testing the product and achieve the goals.
-->It is developed by project manager.
-->Documents like Test Plan are prepared by keeping this document as a base.


13.Test Environment:
--------------------
-->It is the combination of hardware and software on which Test Team performs testing.
