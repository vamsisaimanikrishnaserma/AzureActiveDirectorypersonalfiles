Hi sir good morning
my self vamsikrishna 
i having overall experience 1.1 yr experience in both manual automation testig.
while cmg tools i have knowledge on  Postman for API testing, Ready API,Test complete. iam having basic knowledge on SOAP UI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--> API Questions: 

 --> what is collection in postman
     collection is nothing but it is set of requests group to gethere.you can run of whole group of request just single click.

 --> What is Groovy script?
     the groovy script is used to generate and provide the data into the groovy test request.it is used to verify the groovy response. it can be used for set
     of script property different levels. such as request test step and test case and test suite.

 --> what is payload?
     payload is nothing but body of the request in response message.send and recive in different formats like json formats.

 --> tell me about scopes as well variables?
     there are globel variables,local variable it is allow you to access data between collections requests and test scripts  are avalible workspace.

 --> what is an API?
     api stands for application programming interface.that is useful for communication between different software system.

 --> mention the what are http methods?
     get: Request resource of the server,
     post: create new resource on the server
    ,put: update an existing resource on the server
    ,delete: removes the resource of server   
    ,options,head

 --> mention different between POST AND PUT?
     POST: post request is used for creating a resource. it allows client to create resource without knowing the URL of the new resource
     PUT: put request is used for both creating and updating the new object in the data base if resource already exists the put will updsate resource.
     PATCH: patch is nothing but apply the particular modification resource.

 --> Mention which makeup language can be used in restful web api?
     JSON and XML are two makeup languages that can be used.

 -->difference between soap and rest?
    
 --> what is the rest?
     rest is stands for representational state transfer.and architrectural style basedon (HTTP) hyper texttransfer protocol developed web base application

 --> what is API testing?
    it is one of the challenge type of testing.if we miss certain use cases of api testing.

 --> what is the protocol do rest API
     REST api uses the HTTP protocol to communicate the clients. this allows REST APIs easily deployed over the internet. since http is the same peotocol that
     is used for web pages.

 --> Test automation process?
     Automation type
     automation plan
     automation tool

 Name:
Detection of Transmission Line Fault in the Presence of STATCOM using Wavelets. 

Description:
The main objective is to detect the fault on a Transimission line is used a  WAVELET TRANSFORM in the presence of FACTS device. 

v Three phase currents are monitered at both ends of the Transimission line by global positioning system synchronizing clock. 

v Fault index is calculated based on the sum of local and remote end detail coefficients and compared with threshold value to detect the fault. 

v Proposed technique is tested for various faults and fault inception angles with and without STATCOM device. 

v Simulation results are presented showing the selection of proper threshold value.
 
 wavelet transform technique is applied to detect fault in the transmission line with
flexible alternating current transmission (FACTS) device. Presence of FACTS device
change the system impedance and hence makes it difficult to detect faults on the line
which may result into maloperation of relay.

  Wavelet transforms, which is very fast and sensitive to high frequency signal is used to
extract transients in these line currents for fault detection. Fault index is calculated based
on the sum of local and remote end detail coefficients and compared with threshold
value to detect the fault.

  We have used the STATCOM device I.e,tested for various faults and fault inception
angles with and without static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) device. 

 Simulation results are presented showing the selection of proper threshold value for
fault detection.
 
conclusion:
------> An algorithm for detection of faults in the Transimission line Is
        proposed based on transient component extraction of currents.
-----> v Fault index calculated from detail –I coefficients of currents are
        clearly separable for fault and healthy phases. 
------>v This provide an easy selection of threshold to detect fault in the line.
-------> v Simulation results presented for various faults at different distances
           and inception angles shows that a common threshold is set to detect
           a fault in the line for with and without STATCOM In the system.

JOINS:
joins are used due to the two or more tables will displying single table is known as joins
                                                  (or)
joins are used due to the will disply the multiple tables at a time is known as joins 
joins are used diff types
 eqvi joins,non eqvi join, self join,cross join/cortisian join,outer join
1.eqvi join/inner join:
A: eqvi joins are due to the two are more tables will equalto operator is used eqvi joins.
                                               (or)
   inner join is used due to the common information different tables.
EX. Oracle:
    select * from emp,dept where emp,deptno=dept,deptno;
    ANSI:
    select * from emp join dept on emp,deptno=dept,deptno;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.non-eqvi join:

                                                               Core JAVA


--> java is a simple programming language
--> it is write code and compilation and debugging very easy
--> and it helps create reusable code.
--> java has a more features.

platform indipendent: During compilation of programs convert into byte.using the byte code and we can run the application anywhere windows,mac,linux,etc..
open soure: a program in which source code is avalible to the general public use and modification from original design of free of cost is called open source.
multithredding: java is a multithredding. it enables a program to perform several task simultaniously.
more secure:it provides the application firevals between the applicationand the computer
portable: write once run anywhere

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
--> OOPS:(OBJECTED ORIENTED PROGRAMMING Structure)
      It is used to program methodology and program stetargy it is reqired to full fill the project requirement.
       it is used to 4 pillers are there  

 -->CLASS: Class is noting but collection of methods collection of objects
       Syntax: (first type class name and click ctrl +space)
                public class Bank {
                  } 
               //Bank is a class name
               //public: is a access specifier.

 --> METHOD: Set of actions to be performed. 
         Syntax: public void dummy {
                 } // dummy is methos name
           Main
                 public static void main(String[] args) {
                  }
    ->Public: public is a Access modifier it is used to call any method or class by JVM from anywhere.
    ->static: without creating object we are access the Static method
    ->Void: void is return type we can not return the method that time we can use the void
    ->main: main is the name of method
    ->(String[] args): It is used to command line arguments

 --> OBJECT: Run the memory allocation
             using object we call the any method
         Syntax: (Class name)(object name) = new(class name)

 -->Inheridance: it is used to one class to the methods and variabls are the anothere class rewriting is called inheridance.
 -->abstraction: it is used to hiding of unnesssary data.
 -->encapsulation: it is used to secure data (structure of creatingfolders)
 -->polymorphism: one thing multiple behaviour.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
inheritance types:
 1. single level:  one parent class is directly support into one chaild class using extended keyword.
 2. multi level :  one chaild class and morethen one parent class.
 3. hierarchal  :  one parent class and more then one chaild class.
 4. multiple    :  one class inheritance two parent classes at the same time.
 5. hybrid      :  it is combination of single and multiple inheridance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Method overloading                                                                         method overriding
  1. method over loading develop multiple methods same name           1.method over riding  multiple methods same name  
     different methods is called method overloading.                    different arguments is called method overriding.

  2.over loading is subselected to single class                       2.over riding is inheritance compulsary.

  3.over loading is change the method signature.                      3.over riding is method signature must be same.

  4.we can change the method hadder over loading.                     4.we can't change the method hadder while overriding.
  
  5.over loading will be achive compile time.                         5.over riding will be achived run time.

  6.over loading is an example of compile time polymorphism.          6.over riding will be example of run time polymorphism 

  7.example for overloading is payment travelling                     7.example for over riding is change the callertune.

            C                                                                     JAVA
1. it procedural programing language                                   1.it is object oriented language
2. c is more procedural oriented                                       2.java is data oriented.
3. c is generally break down the functions                             3.java is break down the object.
4. c platform dependent                                                4.java is independent
5. c supports pointers                                                 5.java does not suppoerts pointers.

 module :2

   method without argument:
  method with arguments is the due to the will never write a logic in side class and write a logic inside main method
  Ex: access specifier static/non-static return type
       {
          body of method
       }

method with arguments:
method without arguments is the due to the area of the rectangle area of square method are multiple times same output is the
method with arguments
Ex: public static void add();

method with return type:
whenever we want to our method return type of the particular valuewith return type.
Ex: public static int()
{
body of the operation
}

method overloading:
it is developing multiple method same different methods is called method over loading.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
51.Variables
   Variables are two types 
   local variables
   global variable
   
 local variable:
 variables are declared inside main method(main() and userdefine)with in the scope of class it is called local variables.
 it access of the inside method not outside method

 global variable:
 global variables are due to the declared outside main method(main() and user define ) with in the class such a variables is called 
 global variables.

 1.static variables
 2.non-static variables
 
 1.static variables:
   Variables which are declared out side in the method with in the class such a variables is called static variable.
  Ex: class ex
        {
        static datatype var=value;
         main();
}

2.Non-static variable:
  variables which are declared outside the method with in the class does't contains such a variables is called non-static variable.
   Ex: class ex
         {
           static datatype var=value;
         }
}

   int arr[]={10,324,45,90,9808};
   int max=arrays,stream(arr).max().getas;
   sop("largest given array is"+max);
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
63.pattern printing:
  for(i=1;i<row;i++)
{
for(j=1;j<1;j++)
{
sop("+");
}
sop();
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
64.bubble sort
    bubble sort(arr,size)
    for i=0 to n-i-1
    for j=0 to n-i-2
    if arr[j]>arr[j+1]
    swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]

{
if(num%1=0)
{
count ++;
}
}
if(count==2)
sop(num+"is prime number");
else
sop(num+"is not prime number");
}

69.Different between interface and abstract class
          
               abstract class                                                                                    interface
1. abstract class is does't support multiple inheritance                                              1.interface support multiple inheritance
2. abstarct class is final and non-final,static and non-static                                        2.interface is the static and final variables.
3. abstract class is abstract keyword is used declare abstract class.                                 3.the interface keyword is used declare interface.
4.as abstract class can be extended using keyword extends                                             4.an interface can be implemented using keyword"implemets".
