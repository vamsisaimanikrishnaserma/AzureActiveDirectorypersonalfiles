1. What is manual testing?
A. Manual Testing is an application without using tool. manual testing is nothing but application with in the intent of finding the bugs.
                                                           (or)

   what is the automation testing
   Automation testing is testing or technique is using automation tool write and execute the teststers testscripts and cases.
   The main goal is automation testing is to reduced due to the no.of test cases to be run manually and not eliminate manual to gether.
   benfit:
   ->It execute tasks automatically
   ->incress effectiveness
   ->efficiency

2. STLC(software testing life cycle)
   It is a procedural to test software application.
   1.Requirement analysis
   2.Test planning
   3.Test case development
   4. test environment setup
   5. test execution 
   6.Test cycle closure.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. black box testing?
A. black box testing is the user interface of an application.it is done by the test engineers.
   Black box testing is a tsting which is functionalities of the software application are tested with without knowing code structure and implementation details and internal paths.
   Black box testing is mainly focused on the input and output of the software application and based on the requirements and specifications.
 
 


Types of black box testing.



1.Functional testing:
  it is an writing scripts and validating the business logic and functionality expected from the application.
                                                      (or)
   each and every component is in side of an application to ensure that it is working as per requirement.

2.integration testing:
  it is testing of an data flow between two or more dependent modules.

3.System testing:
  testing is an application it uses the end to end.just like users.

4.Smoke testing:
  it is testing of an basic and critical features of an application.doing throughtesting.like fun,inte,system testing.

5. exploratory testing: 
  it is testing of an application by exploring it throushly.when there requirement.

6. performance testing:
  it is the responce time of an application by applying load.
types: 
     1.Load testing
     2.stress testing
     3.volume testing
     4.soak testing

7. Compatibility testing:
  testing of an application with different hardwares and softwares platforms.

8.globalization testing:
   it is testing of an application which developed the different languages.

9.usability testing:
  testing the users friendlines of an application.

10.reliability testing:
   it is testing the functionality of an application for a long duration of time.

11.Accessibility testing:
   it is an testing of an appplication which is developed for physically challenge people.

12.retesting:
   it is an defect fix of an application.it is done after developed fixes the defects.

13.Regression testing:
  it is testing the impact area of an application.

14.Static testing:
   Testing which is done an documentation is static testsing. 
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. White box testing?
A. white box testing is an source code of an application. it is done by the developer.

--> Gray Box testing?
A: it is the testing of an source code and user interface of an application. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. What is agile model? explain?
A: Agile model is nothing but incremental or interative methodology.It is is keeps on handle those requirements change develop those rquirement change and 
   Testing those rquirement change finally to give software to the customer with in a short span of time then it is called Agile model.
 
   incremental: incremental is nothing but added to the modules then it is known as incremental.    module: Features.
   iterative: iterative is nohing but process will be repeat and repeat then it is known as Iterative. Processs: design will be done,develop will be done,test.

   Advantage: requirement changes the any stage of requirement.
              Main goal of the customer satisfaction.

   Disadvantage: there will be less focus on design and documentation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. SDLC(Software development Life cycle)
    It is procedural to develop the software rquirement.

  Water fall model: When customer freezes the requirement.
  
  Spiral Model: when customer give requirement part a part.

  V and V model: (verification and validation) Customer needs high quality product.

  Prototype: When customer confused with his own requirements.

  Agile Model: When customer wants Applicationvery fast and with less time.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Why testing is important?
A. every application is developed for business purpose. testing is not done it can lead defects/bugs.it will spread negative in the market due 
   to many people stop the using an application.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. different operating systems.
A.Microsoft windows, macOS, Linux, Android, IOS, windows7, ChromeOS, blackbarry, etc....
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Different browsers
A. Firefox, Chrome, safari,opera, microsoft edge, internet explorer,mozila,chromium etc...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.BUG:
A.It is an informal name of an defects.
  Whenever  a defect is found by the test engineers.
 it should be raised to the developers.once the developers accept the defects.it is termed as bug.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11.Error?
A. Mistake the source code of an is called error.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12.What is waterfall model?
A: The water fal model is a classic model is used in system developement life cycle to create  a system with a linear and seqential approach.

    --> Requirement Gathering
	--> Analysis Read
	--> System Design
	--> Implementation
	--> Deployment
	--> Maintanance
	
Adv: Esy to use and simple and understandable
     works well and smaller projects requirement clearly.
     process and output of each phase are clearly mentioned in the document.

Dis: Change the requirement can't be accommodated in any phase.
     Risk and uncertainly are high.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13.Spiral model?
A. The spiral model is systems developmet life cycle method is used for risk management that combines the iterative development
   process model with element of the waterfall model.

Adv: It is best development model risk analysis risk handling at any phase
Dis: It is not suitable for low risk projects.
     It is not suitable for small projects as it is expensive.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. What is the V and V model (Verification and Validation)?
A. Verification: verification is the process evaluating the software product under SDLC To check we are right in the track of creating final projects  
   Validation: Validation is the process of evaluating the final product to check software business needs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. what is assertion?
A:
